Please remember to record the lesson.\nEach learner selects a key point to contribute material on. Use the lesson issue for that topic to assign yourself and another learner to review your contribution.\nMake a draft pull request to the lesson branch and ask the other learner assigned to review. Make changes until you’re both happy.\nMark the pull request as ready, and request the instructor to review.\nWhen the instructor is happy with the changes they should merge the learners contribution back into their lesson branch.\nThe instructor reviews and merges the lesson branch when all contributions have been received. It is the responsibility of the teacher to make sure contributions have been received after two weeks.\n\n\n\nReview lessons\nEach lesson should be followed up by a review lesson the following week. Here, the teacher should review and discuss points that they notice learners had difficulty with.\n\n\nSequence diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    box transparent Learners\n        actor Learner1\n        actor Learner2\n    end\n    actor Teacher\n    Teacher -&gt;&gt; GitHub: New branch for lesson\n    Teacher -&gt;&gt; GitHub: New lesson file\n    Teacher -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Add key points\n    Teacher -&gt;&gt; Learner1: Demonstrates tool\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; Teacher: Volunteers to write up keypoint 2\n    Learner2 -&gt;&gt; Teacher: Volunteers to write up keypoint 1\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Make branch from lesson branch\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Add notes for keypoint 2\n    Learner2 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Add notes for keypoint 1\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Request Learner2 to review text\n    Learner2 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Request Learner1 to review text\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Provide code review\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Update notes from review\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; Teacher: Request code review\n    Learner1 -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Update notes\n    Teacher -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Merges notes into lesson branch\n    Teacher -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Merges lesson branch into main\n    GitHub -&gt;&gt; GitHub: Automated website build",
